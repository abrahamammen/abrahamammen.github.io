            <h3>Projects</h3>
			<h5> UGA Hacks5</h5>
			<p>“Epilogue” – With a team of 4, we developed a prototype modular device for JUUL, designed to help put an end to nicotine addiction. We simultaneously developed the “Epilogue app” that provides the user with daily status, progress and alerts fetched from the modular device which helps the user limit the use of JUUL. To develop the device, I learned how to use android-studio, Arduino and java.
